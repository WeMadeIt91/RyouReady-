### WHOA!!!! THIS IS THE FILE FORMAT SYNTAX I'VE SEEN ON GITHUB THAT TURNS THE CODE INTO A DYNAMIC DOCUMENT!!!!!
## This is going to take my portfolio to the next level! Seamless code!!

# Penguins Plots: Practice Analysis
## Setting up my environment 
Notes: Setting up my R environment by loading the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

*Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the *R code that generated the plot.

*start code chunk: ctrl+alt+i*

*To start a new paragraph, end a line with two spaces*

*To apply italics to a word or phrase, place an asterisk at the beginning and at the end of the word or phrase, for* example, *italics works*

*To apply bold to a word or phrase, place two asterisks at the beginning and at the end of the word or phrase, for* example, **bold is useful***

*To create a header, type a hashtag (#) followed by a space and your text for example: # Getting Started with R* Markdown*

*Headers will appear in blue*

*A single hashtag is the largest header*

*The more hashtags you add (up to six), the smaller the header*
