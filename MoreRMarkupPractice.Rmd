## R Markdown Intro Editing, It's just HTML!

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring:

* HTML  
* PDF  
* MS Word document

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
![Plot this way](https://toppng.com/uploads/preview/arrow-blue-down-clip-art-blue-arrow-pointing-dow-11562998829k8g0r2vcce.png) *will figure out how to resize and remove the background*

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
